# Contact List Azure API App Sample #

This is a simple example of how to build an [API App](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/ "What are API Apps?") for deployment into the Azure App Service. This example API App uses a Web API back end and a simple HTML/AngularJS client to communicate with the API.
